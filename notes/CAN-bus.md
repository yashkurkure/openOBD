# Notes on the CAN bus


## CAN vs OBD-II
CAN is one of the transport protocols of the OBD-II specification and should be supported by most OBD-II-Scanners The location of the port can be found using a Google (image) search. Usually the port is located in reach of the driver, e.g. under the dashboard or hidden in the center console.

OBD-II is a higher-level protocol used for diagnostic purposes. OBD-II can use one of (many) different bus systems to transfer diagnostic data from and to your car. Think of OBD-II as a language (English) that you speak and of CAN as the communication device (telephone) you use to talk to someone (about your car and its state of health).
